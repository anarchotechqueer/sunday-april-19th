    <pre className='lyrics'>{`
when you were a child on the farm
you saw him pin her by the weight of his arms
so she left in the night when you were in bed
and took your trust when she left

you're already hurt
im scared that if you put
your trust in me i'll make it worse
i'll hurt you

i picked a flower from the stem
and watched it die in my hands
and i screamed, "oh my god
i did it again, im destroying innocence

so i can't stay
my heart's too weak to think
about the way you use to say
i miss you`
    }
      
    </pre>
